**Vibrant Anime Avatars with Real-Time Creation**

AnimeAvatars is a web application that lets users express themselves by creating fully customizable anime avatars. With real-time creation tools, an interactive gallery, and community chat features, users can design unique avatars, share them, and connect with others.

This project was built using **[Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)** — an AI-powered development platform — along with Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.  
It was initially generated with the help of AI, but I actively solved multiple development challenges myself, ensuring smooth functionality, bug fixes, and improved user experience.
